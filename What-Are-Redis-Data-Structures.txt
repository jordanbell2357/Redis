Welcome to this chapter. In the next few chapters we'll cover all the basic Redis
data structures. We will start with keys and automatic expiration. After that,
we'll cover strings and how basic values are stored and manipulated. Hashes allow
manipulations of fields and value pairs. This chapter will finish with lists, the
first of the collection datatypes. In a later chapter,
we'll cover the other collection data structures of sets and sorted sets. As we
discuss each data structure, we'll do a quick dive into typical use cases for
each. Please utilize the handout links for each unit in this chapter. The links
will take you to the documentation for the commands. This is a handy resource
that will provide you with a quick reference as we discuss each data
structure in detail. Throughout the course, we'll include highlights of the
command syntax. The documentation  will always provide the
definitive reference for each command, so I do encourage you to leverage this
valuable resource.
